          I've dedicated this website to my reflections on philosophy in practice in business and in life, along with the occasional watercolor cartoon. I am one of the original founders of 
          =link_to "RateMyStudyAbroad.com,", "http://ratemystudyabroad.com"
          an independent website for student reviews of study abroad programs, now the review website partner of 
          =link_to "GoAbroad.com.", "http://goabroad.com"
